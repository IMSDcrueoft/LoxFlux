# Loxed(clox enhanced) Project Introduction

## Introduction

Lox is a programming language designed for learning purposes. It is conceived as a small and easy-to-understand language, perfect for those who want to build their own interpreter or compiler. The Lox language and its associated tutorials were originally introduced by Bob Nystrom in his online book "Crafting Interpreters". ([Book URL](https://craftinginterpreters.com/))
